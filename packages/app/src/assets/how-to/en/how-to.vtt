In this video, I'll show you how to use the Vocably extension.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.080
For example, I study German.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.440
I go to any German website and start reading.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.900
When I see a word I don't know yet,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.600
I highlight it and translate it using the Vocably extension.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.760
Then I click the "Learn" button and the word goes to my collection.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.560
Then once a day, I take my phone and learn the words from my collection.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:33.560
