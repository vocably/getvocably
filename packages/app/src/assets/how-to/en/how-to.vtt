In this video, I'll show you how I use the Vocably extension.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.110
For example, I study German. I go to any German website and start reading.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.310
When I see a word I don't know yet,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.710
I highlight and translate it with the Vocably extension.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.670
Then I click the "Learn" button, and the word goes to my collection.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.150
Then once a day, I take my phone and learn the words from my collection.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.040
